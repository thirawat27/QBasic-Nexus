  <h1>QBasic Nexus ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>
</div>

<p>
Enhances QBasic development in VS Code with syntax highlighting, code snippets, and robust support for your <strong>externally installed QB64 compiler</strong>. Features include auto-detection of your QB64 installation or manual path configuration.
</p>

<br>

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Flexible QB64 Integration**:
    *   **Auto-Detection**: Attempts to automatically find your existing QB64 installation on startup.
    *   **Manual Configuration**: Allows you to specify the exact path to your QB64 executable via VS Code settings.
*   **Compile & Run üöÄ**: Compile your QBasic code and run it in the integrated terminal with a single command.
*   **Compile Only üåÄ**: Compile your code to create a standalone executable file (`.exe` on Windows, or a plain executable on macOS/Linux).
*   **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Status Bar Integration**: Easily access the compile command from an icon in the status bar whenever a `.bas` or `.bi` file is open.
*   **Detailed Output Panel**: View detailed logs, progress, and errors from the compilation process in a dedicated "QBasic Nexus Compiler" output channel.
*   **Integrated Terminal Execution**: Runs the compiled program directly in the VS Code integrated terminal.
*   **Customizable Compiler Arguments**: Pass additional arguments to the QB64 compiler via settings.
*   **Syntax Highlighting & Snippets**: Rich language support for QBasic and QB64.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

For QBasic Nexus to compile your code using your QB64 installation, ensure QB64 is correctly set up on your system.

*   **All Systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)**:
    *   **QB64 Must Be Installed**: You need to have a working installation of QB64 (preferably QB64 Phoenix Edition from [qb64.org](https://qb64.com/)).
    *   The extension will attempt to auto-detect it. If not found, you'll need to set the path manually (see Configuration section).

*   **macOS (If QB64 requires it)**:
    *   **Xcode Command Line Tools** must be installed if your QB64 version depends on them for C++ compilation.
    *   To install: `xcode-select --install`

*   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based, if QB64 requires it)**:
    *   The **build-essential** package (which includes `g++`) must be installed if your QB64 version depends on it.
    *   To install: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential`

*(Note: QB64 Phoenix Edition for Windows typically includes its own MinGW C++ compiler, so no extra C++ tools are usually needed on Windows.)*

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Install QB64**: If you haven't already, download and install QB64 from [https://qb64.com/](https://qb64.com/).
2.  **Install this Extension**: Find "QBasic Nexus" in the VS Code Marketplace and install it.
3.  **Compiler Path Configuration (If Needed)**:
    *   On first activation (or if the path is not set), the extension will try to auto-detect your QB64 installation.
    *   If successful, and you confirm by clicking "Yes, use this path" in the notification, the path will be saved in your global settings.
    *   If auto-detection fails, or you prefer to set it manually:
        1.  Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
        2.  Search for `QBasic Nexus Compiler Path`.
        3.  Enter the **full, absolute path** to your `qb64.exe` (Windows) or `qb64` (macOS/Linux) executable.
            *   Example Windows: `C:\QB64\qb64.exe`
            *   Example macOS: `/Applications/qb64/qb64`
            *   Example Linux: `/home/youruser/qb64/qb64`
4.  **Open a QBasic File**: Open a file with a `.bas` or `.bi` extension.
5.  **Using the Extension**:
    *   When a `.bas` or `.bi` file is active and the compiler path is set, you'll see a **`üî• Compile .BAS`** icon in the Status Bar.
    *   If the path is not set, the Status Bar will show **`‚ö†Ô∏è Set QB64 Path`**. Clicking it will open the settings.

## üì¶ Available Commands

*   `qbasic-nexus.compile`:
    *   **Title in Palette/Menu**: `Compile .BAS file üåÄ`
    *   **Action**: Compiles the currently active `.bas` or `.bi` file. Creates an executable in the same directory.
    *   **Accessed via**: Command Palette, Right-click context menu, Status Bar icon.

*   `qbasic-nexus.compileAndRun`:
    *   **Title in Palette/Menu**: `Compile & Run .BAS file üöÄ`
    *   **Action**: Compiles the file. If successful, it runs the program in a new "QBasic Nexus: Run Output" integrated terminal.
    *   **Accessed via**: Command Palette, Right-click context menu.

## üìÑ Understanding the Output

*   **Output Panel ("QBasic Nexus Compiler" channel)**:
    *   Shows auto-detection attempts, compiler path information, the exact command being executed, and detailed compilation logs (COMPILE SUCCESSFUL ‚úÖ or COMPILE FAILED ‚ùå, error messages from QB64).
*   **Terminal Panel ("QBasic Nexus: Run Output" tab)**:
    *   Displays the output of your running QBasic program (e.g., from `PRINT` statements) when using "Compile & Run".
*   **Executable File**:
    *   Created in the same directory as your source `.bas` or `.bi` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can configure the extension via VS Code Settings:

*   **Setting ID**: `qbasic-nexus.compilerPath`
    *   **Description**: Full path to your QB64 executable.
        *   Examples:
            *   Windows: `C:\QB64\qb64.exe`
            *   macOS: `/Applications/qb64/qb64` or `~/qb64/qb64`
            *   Linux: `/usr/local/bin/qb64` or `~/qb64/qb64`
        *   Leave empty to trigger auto-detection on startup/setting change.

*   **Setting ID**: `qbasic-nexus.compilerArgs`
    *   **Description**: Optional additional arguments to pass to the QB64 compiler (e.g., `-w` for more warnings, `-g` for debug symbols, `-prof` for profiling). Arguments should be space-separated.
    *   **Default**: Empty (no additional arguments).

Search for "QBasic Nexus" in VS Code Settings to find these options.
