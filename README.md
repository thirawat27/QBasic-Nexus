This extension bundles the QB64 compiler for Windows, macOS, and Linux, enabling you to get started with QBasic development without any separate installation of QB64.

 <!-- You can replace this with a real screenshot of the extension in action -->

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Compile & Run**: Compile your QBasic code and run it in the integrated terminal with a single command.
*   **Compile Only**: Compile your code to create a standalone executable file (`.exe` on Windows).
*   **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Bundled Compiler**: No need to install QB64 separately. The necessary compilers are included with the extension.
*   **Status Bar Integration**: Easily access the compile command from an icon in the status bar whenever a `.bas` or `.bi`file is open.
*   **Detailed Output Panel**: View detailed logs, progress, and errors from the compilation process in a dedicated "QB64 Compiler" output channel.
*   **Integrated Terminal Execution**: Runs the compiled program directly in the VS Code integrated terminal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

For the bundled QB64 compiler to work correctly, some system-level tools are required.

*   **Windows**:
    *   No prerequisites needed. It works out of the box!

*   **macOS**:
    *   **Xcode Command Line Tools** must be installed.
    *   To install them, open a Terminal and run:
        ```sh
        xcode-select --install
        ```

*   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based)**:
    *   The **build-essential** package (which includes `g++` and other necessary tools) must be installed.
    *   To install it, open a Terminal and run:
        ```sh
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential
        ```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  Install this extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2.  Open a QBasic file with a `.bas` or `.bi`  extension.
3.  When a `.bas` or `.bi` file is active, you will see a **`üî• Compile .BAS (QBasic)`** icon appear in the Status Bar (usually at the bottom-left).
4.  You can execute commands in two ways:

    *   **Method 1: Using the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)**
        *   To **Compile and RunüöÄ** : Type `QBLegacy.compileAndRun` and press Enter.
        *   To **Compile OnlyüåÄ** : Type `QBLegacy.compile` and press Enter.

    *   **Method 2: Clicking the Status Bar Icon**
        *   Clicking the **`üî• Compile .BAS (QBasic)`** icon in the status bar will trigger the **Compile OnlyüåÄ** command.

## üì¶ Available Commands

*   `QBLegacy.compile`:
    *   **Title**: Compile QBasic File
    *   **Action**: Compiles the currently active `.bas` or `.bi` file and creates an executable file (e.g., `program.exe` on Windows or `program` on macOS/Linux) in the same directory.

*   `QBLegacy.compileAndRun`:
    *   **Title**: Compile and Run QBasic File
    *   **Action**: First, it compiles the file. If successful, it automatically opens a new terminal named "QB64 Run" and executes the program.

## üìÑ Understanding the Output

*   **Output Panel**:
    *   All compilation results (compiler messages, COMPILE SUCCESSFUL `‚úÖ` or COMPILE FAILED `‚ùå` status) are displayed in the **Output** panel under the **"QB64 Compiler"** channel.
    *   If compilation fails, this panel will provide detailed error messages to help you debug your code.

*   **Terminal Panel**:
    *   When using the "Compile and Run" command, the output from your running QBasic program (e.g., from `PRINT` statements) will be displayed in the **Terminal** panel under the **"QB64 Run"** tab.

*   **Executable File**:
    *   The compiled application file will be created in the same directory as your source `.bas` or `.bi` file.
